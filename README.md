## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Linear Programming (LP)** techniques to solve a classic **Transportation Problem** — optimizing the cost of distributing goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations. The goal is to **minimize total transportation cost** while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

---

## 🧮 Problem Statement

Given:
- A set of **supply centers** (e.g., factories, warehouses)
- A set of **demand centers** (e.g., stores, cities)
- A **cost matrix** representing transportation costs between each pair

The objective is to determine how much each supply center should send to each demand center to **minimize cost** while:
- Not exceeding supply limits
- Meeting demand requirements
